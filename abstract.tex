  Proof automation is crucial to large-scale formal mathematics and software/hardware verification projects
  in ITPs. Sophisticated tools called hammers have been developed to provide general-purpose proof
  automation in ITPs such as Coq and Isabelle, leveraging the power of ATPs. An important
  component of a hammer is the translation algorithm from the ITP's logical system
  to the ATP's logical system. In this paper, we propose a novel translation algorithm
  for ITPs based on dependent type theory. The algorithm is implemented in Lean4 under
  the name Lean-auto. When combined with existing tools, Lean-auto provides
  general-purpose, ATP-based proof automation in Lean4 for the first time.
  Soundness of the main translation procedure is guaranteed, and experimental results suggest that
  our algorithm is sufficiently complete for practical uses of Lean4.
  We also show that our algorithm produces more efficient
  translations compared to the encoding-based approach used in CoqHammer.
